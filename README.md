# Trading-Bot
Trading bot for trading crypto using fake balances

# Different Bots:

Simple Bot: Keeps track of the value of Ethereum from the last trade. If the current price is higher than the previous price and some threshold, we buy. If lower than some threshold, we sell otherwise we hold.
Checks every 10 minutes. Keeps track of the price, trade decision, ethereum balance, euro balance, original value, current value and profit. Transaction fees are not included.
Loses money gradually

Several more bots will be implemented with more complicated trading decisions.
